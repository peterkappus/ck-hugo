Saturday, January 28 - 2:00 EST - Make it yours! For harpers with a bit of
experience. We’ll look at ways to get started with improvising and ways
to use this to arrange and compose. We’ll look at interesting left hand
patterns and chord choices. If you’re curious to know how I comes up
with all those tunes, I’ll show you exactly what I do so you can give it a
try.
Scores and the Zoom Link will be emailed to you.
The workshop will be 90 minutes long, followed by a Q and A session for
those who want to stay.
