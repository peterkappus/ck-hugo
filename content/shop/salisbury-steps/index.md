This piece was written on the front steps to the beautiful cathedral in Salisbury, England. It was a beautiful summer evening and dusk was falling.  The cathedral was closed but inside, the organ repair men were hard at work.  Occasionally I would hear them try out the tuning by playing a window-rattling loud passage from a famous organ piece.
