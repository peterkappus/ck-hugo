Nine beautiful arrangements from Carol’s Music of Ireland show. If you enjoy this book, also check out the sequel "<a href="/shop/more-magical-irish-tunes">More Magical Irish Tunes</a>".

### The Quiet Land of Erin
Another one of those beautiful, melancholy songs of homesickness for the beautiful land of Ireland.  I arranged this with lots of dramatic rising chord runs which symbolize the waves crashing against the rocky shore.

### Cape Clear
One of my favorites.  This tune fits the hand so well, it is pure      	pleasure to play.

h4 Two beautiful lullabies :
### Baloo Baleerie
A Gaelic lullaby.  This can be played as a solo or as an ensemble piece.  The directions of how to do this are on page 6.

### Gartan Mother’s Lullaby
This tune makes a nice medley paired with Baloo Baleerie. They have the same ending to tie them together.  Gartan Mother’s Lullaby has beautiful words so you can sing it too or accompany a friend as they sing it.

### Brian Boru’s March
Brian Boru was a famous warrior and High King of Ireland who died in 1014.  There are many versions of this famous march.  Hope you like this one! Play it strong and fiercely!

### The Last Rose of Summer
The famous song written by poet Thomas Moore in 1805. This is beautiful played as a solo but you can also sing the brilliant words or have someone sing them as you play.  I have included it in a high and low key so you can fit it to your voice if you want to sing. 
High key:  C 	Low key:  G

### Danny Boy
My very schlurpy version of this much-loved tune.

### Lord Galway’s Lament
My favorite O’Carolan tune.  Simple but haunting. This can be played as an ensemble piece (directions on page 18).   I often pair this with The Foggy Dew.

### The Foggy Dew
A mournful lament and rebel tune about the Easter Uprising of 1916.
