Saturday, January 21 - 2:00 EST - Magic Hands! 
For any level. Iâ€™ll show
you how to learn my method of using shapes to make playing easier and
how to apply it to your music. This is a popular workshop and many
harpers have found it very helpful.
Scores and the Zoom Link will be emailed to you.
The workshop will be 90 minutes long, followed by a Q and A session for
those who want to stay.
