This book contains some favorite arrangements that were requested by friends and students including the following:

### Danny Boy
 My new very schlurpy arrangement that many people liked when it appeared recently  in Folk Harp Journal.
### Women of Ireland
This arrangement is flashy but chord based so not hard to play.
### Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier/ Siuil a RÃ¹n
Lots of lush chords.  Schlurpy and sentimental but not hard to play.
### Summer Dreaming
A relaxing tune to play, based on 7 chords.   Easy.
### The Water is Wide,  Shall We Gather at the River, Shenandoah
A beautiful medely which can be used as a solo, or played by an ensemble.  Each tune can also be played individually.
