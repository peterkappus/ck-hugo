_Songs for Skye_ is a book of stories and sheet music for Celtic harp inspired by the Isle of Skye on the western edge of Scotland.
For years, Carol has been visiting the Isle of Skye to study Gaelic language and music. <i>Songs for Skye</i> features beautiful full-color photographs, descriptions of Carol's favorite experiences and places on Skye, and sheet music for eleven of Carol’s original Celtic harp compositions inspired by these places and events, and nine arrangements of traditional Celtic songs she learned on Skye. 

Songs are suitable for a variety of levels from intermediate to advanced Celtic harpers. The book is 40+ printed pages with plastic comb binding so it will lie completely flat when open on your music stand.
