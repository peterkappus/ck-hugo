I wrote this little tune when I was experimenting with creating tunes using simple hand positions. I almost threw it out because I thought it was too simple. Imagine my surprise when I started trying it out on my students and they really liked it! Then I was touched and amazed to find that this tune works well as a harp therapy tune and the two adults with severe autism we played it for really loved it. So I hope you will love this little tune too and will share it as a tune for peace, calm and healing.

Happy Harping! 
Carol
