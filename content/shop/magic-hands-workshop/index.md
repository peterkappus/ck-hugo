## What is it?
Want to experience more stability in your playing? More flow? Here’s a chance
to try my Magic Hands system in a live workshop with me on Zoom. In the first 50 minutes,
I will lead you through how the Magic Hands system works and how to build it into your
hands. Then after a short rest break, I'll will teach you a few tunes by ear using this
system, which might be totally different than what you have been doing so far!
You will receive a packet of information about the shapes and chords we will be working
with and some tunes you can learn by using these shapes. If you are still playing note by
note, this will let you experience a totally different way to think about placing your hands.
It’s like a short cut system for your hands!

## Where?
In your harp room! Carol will send you a Zoom link and packet of written scores
on Thursday, November 4 for this live Zoom event.

If you want more information about the Magic Hands system, you can read about it in the
Winter 2019 edition of Folk Harp Journal, or you can [buy the write-up of the system here](/shop/magic-hands/).

I look forward to getting to know more of you in person and sharing this little system with
you which I hope will help you move toward your harping goals of solid, fluid playing.
