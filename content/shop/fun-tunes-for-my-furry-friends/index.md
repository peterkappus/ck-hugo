Our pets are such an important part of our families these days. So I decided to write some tunes for some of my furry friends. These sweet little animals all have such different personalities which I attempted to capture in their tunes. I hope that as you play these fun little tunes, you feel like you know these special furry friends at least a little bit. And I hope these tunes bring a smile to your face and you enjoy playing them as much as I enjoyed creating them. Happy Harping! Carol

Below is a tune from my latest book, Fun Tunes for My Furry Friends in which I tried to capture the personality of the pets and furry friends belonging to me and my harper friends. This tune was written for a little cat named Jazz.  Here’s what her owner said about her:

"We found Jazz in a woodchuck hole behind our barn. She was a little rough looking at first, but she knew what she wanted and she got it. She was tiny and in charge. Her demanding meow sounded more like a screech owl and she could boss around our other pets (and us) with just one withering look. Jazz loved sunshine and boxes. And living with us."

This tune is very jazzy and fun to play, especially the part where you use lever slides to simulate the sound of Jazz meowing!
