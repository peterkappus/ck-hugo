Saturday, February 4 - 2:00 EST - Cool tunes! Learn one or two Carol
Kappus tunes from the composer. Scores will be provided but we’ll do
hands on learning the way I would teach you in a private lesson. For
beginners and up, we’ll have a look at my best seller, Summer Dreamin’.
Then for intermediate players, learn the fun and jazzy tune: Jazz Takes
Charge, where I try to capture the personality of my friend Pat’s cat Jazz.
You’ll learn interesting syncopations and use your levers to imitate Jazz’s
bossy meow. If you’re fast learners, we might get to a third tune as well!
Scores and the Zoom Link will be emailed to you.
The workshop will be 90 minutes long, followed by a Q and A session for
those who want to stay.
