There are so many wonderful recordings of these tunes available to us now on Youtube. I have suggested for each tune, my favorite recording for you to listen to to give you an idea of the feeling of each song. I hope you enjoy playing these wonderful tunes as much as I do!

## Ar Hyd Y Nos
The beautiful lullaby we all know and love, All Through the Night. To hear the most beautiful recording of this, check out [Bryn Terfel singing it on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWU07oVhF_4)


## Ar Lan Y Môr
An amazing love song! This one is dreamy and wonderful. To hear the best recording of this song ever, go to Youtube and listen to Welsh baritone, Bryn Terfel sing it. Wow. [Prepare for your heart to melt!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYNH_hedOB0). You can also [hear a sample of Carol playing this song](#sample).

## Calon Lân
A favorite in Wales and often sung by the crowd at sports matches, surprisingly, this beautiful song is about placing a pure heart above importance of earthly riches. Once again, to hear a really great rendition of this song, [check out Only Boys Aloud on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AARrVAHnkdY&t=135s) The actual song starts at 2:15.


## Cysga Di Fy Mhlentyn Tlws 
Another beautiful cradle song, translated as “Go to sleep my sweet child”. I think this would make a lovely tune for harp therapists. I have done two arrangements of this one: one for players just getting started and another one that is a bit more complex. I hope one of these will fit you! To hear what this sounds like in Welsh, [here’s a lovely video of this beautiful tune.](https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzgKC-VaqDE)
Easier version page 10; more complex version on page 12.


## Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau
This is the national anthem of Wales and in Wales, everyone knows it and sings it with amazing fervor. Once again, I suggest you [listen to a wonderful recording on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wcuwDXFS5Y) to get the feel you should try to capture as you play this

## Lisa Lân
A melancholy and bittersweet love song. So simple yet so beautiful. It took me forever to figure this one out so I hope you like it as much as I do. I wrote on for my electric harp where it sounds incredibly glowy and flowy, but I think it’s very pretty on acoustic as well. For a beautiful recording, [try this one by Gwilym Bowen Rhys and Alaw.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkFG7PEUDug)

## Myfanwy 
This beautiful song of love betrayed is a big favorite of men’s choruses in Wales and male singers in general. I just love the arching downward 6ths in the climactic part of this song. Don’t play this straight! Let the emotion of this song shine through. For an amazing recording, listen to much-loved Welsh singer, performer and amazing harper, [Ryan Davies on this video.](https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH3yqBW1AJ4)

## Suo Gân 
Described as A parent's song of protection and responsibility, Suo Gân, is a traditional Welsh lullaby, or “lull song”, from the title's translation (suo = lull; gân = song). I’m sure you’ve heard this famous song and I hope you will enjoy my take on it. [Beautiful, beautiful video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM9uyA0wVIA)


## Y Dydd 
Famous Welsh triple harper Robin Huw Bowen who found it on a loose sheet of paper in the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. No information, no history, just this lovely little tune. It’s very fun to play and I especially love the way the 2nd part mimics the sound of the triple harp.
