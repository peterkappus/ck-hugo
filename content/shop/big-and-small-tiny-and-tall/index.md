These arrangements are in pairs. The first one is always for the small lap harp and the second for the larger floor harp. Sometimes they’re similar and sometimes they are very different! The small harp arrangements tend to be easier to play but I hope you will find one that fits your playing level and the sound you like! Happy Harping!
